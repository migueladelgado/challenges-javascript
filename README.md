## Power the Neighborhood
This challenge requires to write an algorithm to calculate the number of days it would take to turn on power for each house in a neighborhood where a 2D array is given and each item in the inner arrays is considered a house.

in the example below we have to rows (streets) with 4 homes in each.
The 0 values represent no power, and 1 with power. Only a home with power
can turn on power for an adjacent home and they can only do this once a day.
How many days would it take?
For the example below it would be 3 days.
```
[
    [0,1,0,0],
    [0,0,0,1]
]
```
